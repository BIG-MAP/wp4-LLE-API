# Liquid Liquid Movable Photoelectric Sensor Dataset

This is a dataset generated by using the photoelectric sensor setup depicted in *Movable optical sensor for automatic detection and monitoring of liquid-liquid interfaces*.

The ClearOil folder contains subfolders with the name *ClearOilXX* where the number replacing XX indicates the true interface position along the sensor belt in mm.

The Extraction folder contains the same type of subfolders named after the main solvent used (e.g. *Ethyl20*) but grouped using their extraction step (e.g. Drain or Settling).

Each subfolder contains a Metadata.txt file detailing the liquids in each layer and the true position of the interface, and one or more *DataXX* subfolder with the actual data in a .csv file, captured by the different channels in the photoelectric sensor (Sparkfun Triad Spectroscopy).

Each data folder contains also images at each position of the sensor along the belt, taken with a webcam (ELP USBFHD01M) mounted to the side of the photoelectric sensor.
